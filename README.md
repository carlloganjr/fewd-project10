The goal is to utilize an API using AJAX to create an employee directory.

## Built With

* [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
* [Random User](https://randomuser.me/) - API used to generate information

## Authors

## Notes

The randomuser.me API was well documented and easy to use.  This was a good project to become familiar with using an API.  Creating the modal proved to be the only challenge which was quickly remedied with a few tweaks to the code.
